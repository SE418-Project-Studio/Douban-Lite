## Idea
Our project contains two main service.<br>

One is planed to handle the intialization and result of the games, when one player clicks the start button, it will find another equally skillful player who is also waiting for a rival and bring them to their battlefield. When the game reaches its end, it will update the user database.<br>

The other is planned to provide game service, such as generating a new map and tracking the operation made by the two players and telling the first service who is the winner.<br>

And there are several other small services to support the whole project.
